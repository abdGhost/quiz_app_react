🍹 Crafting Your Unique Fairness Smoothie: The Formula
After blending your chosen ingredient (Client Seed), the visit number (Nonce), and our secret recipe (Server Seed) in our magical blender (the HMAC_SHA256 process), we reach a crucial step in crafting your unique smoothie.

🥄 The Essence of Fairness: The Formula
Tasting the Essence (Hash Conversion):

We take a snippet of our magical blend's essence (8 characters from the hash) and convert this mystical code into a tangible number that we can measure. This conversion uses the hexadecimal system to transform the characters into an int32 value, a process akin to deciphering the intensity of flavors in our smoothie.
Balancing the Sweetness (Calculating the Result):

The formula to ensure every sip is just right is as follows:
Result
=
(
Converted Value
0
�
100000000
×
10001
)
÷
100
Result=( 
0x100000000
Converted Value
​
 ×10001)÷100
Here’s what we do:
Divide the Converted Value by 
0
�
100000000
0x100000000: This scales down the intensity to a manageable level, ensuring the flavor (outcome) isn't too overwhelming.
Multiply by 10001: This step adjusts the flavor to be within the perfect range, ensuring that every sip offers a new taste.
Divide by 100: Finally, we refine the flavor to ensure it fits within the expected taste profile (the game's result range), making sure it's neither too sweet nor too bland.
Ensuring a New Experience Every Time (Seed Refresh):

Just as we might change the secret ingredients for the next smoothie, a new seed is set for the next game to verify the previous blend was made fairly. This ensures that the smoothie bar (game platform) remains a place of endless variety and fairness.
🌟 Enjoying Your Smoothie
By following this formula, we guarantee that each smoothie you enjoy at our virtual bar is a one-of-a-kind creation, blending fairness with fun. This detailed recipe, though intricate, is shared openly to ensure you can trust the integrity of each sip (game outcome).

So, next time you're here, remember that behind every smoothie (game result) is a carefully crafted formula designed to ensure fairness, transparency, and satisfaction. Cheers to many more unique and fair gaming experiences!

3. Adjusting the Taste (Final Calculation for Fairness)
🍹 Taste Test: Adjusting the blend's intensity by dividing the int32 value by 0x100000000 and then multiplying by 10000, ensuring it's just right.
4. Serving and Enjoying (Seed Verification and Transparency)
🔄 New Recipe for Verification: Changing the seeds (ingredients) for the next blend, like deciding on a new smoothie recipe.
📜 Transparency: Sharing the recipe process with your customers, showcasing the craft behind the smoothie.
Interactive Guide Visualization
Imagine each step of the process represented on a virtual kitchen countertop:

Step 1: You see a cutting board with strawberries, blueberries, and a banana. Next to it, a digital scale represents the hashing process.

Step 2: A measuring cup indicates the portioning of the hash into an int32 value.

Step 3: A mixing spoon and a recipe book are open, suggesting the adjustment of the smoothie's flavor to ensure it meets the desired taste profile.

Step 4: A new set of ingredients is ready for the next recipe, alongside an encrypted recipe card, ensuring the next smoothie remains a surprise until served.

This guide, with its icons and steps, provides a playful yet insightful way to understand the process of ensuring fairness in digital games, akin to crafting the perfect smoothie. It bridges the complexity of cryptographic processes with the simplicity and enjoyment of making a delicious drink.

----------MINES-----------------

🍹 Ingredients (Setup)
Imagine you're making a unique smoothie. The ingredients are numbers (fruits), and the recipe is determined by a combination of server seed, client seed, and nonce (like a unique blending process).

🍓 Fruits (Numbers): A predefined list of fruits (numbers) that will go into the smoothie.
🔧 Blending Process (Hash Calculation): A unique way to blend these fruits based on the "server seed", "client seed", and "nonce". This is akin to the HMAC_SHA256 hash calculation that determines the order and repetition of fruits in the smoothie.
📜 Recipe (Code Breakdown)
🔀 Combining Ingredients (Generating the Hash):

You have a unique way (algorithm) to blend ingredients based on your preferences (clientSeed and nonce) and the blender's capabilities (serverSeed).
The main function starts the process by combining the clientSeed and nonce, then blending them with the serverSeed to create a unique hash.
🍹 Blending Steps (getResult Function):

First Blend: Start with an initial mix (hash) and then create a sequence of fruits based on this mix.
Re-Blend: To ensure the smoothie has a unique taste, we re-blend it by taking the initial mix, further hashing it to create a new sequence.
🍽 Serving the Smoothie (createNums Function):

Each fruit is associated with a hash value, determining its place in the blend.
The fruits are sorted based on their hash values, ensuring each smoothie has a unique taste and texture.
🕹 Interactive Example
Let's make it interactive by considering you have a choice of different seeds (blender settings) and fruits (numbers). You can select your own "clientSeed", "nonce", and "serverSeed" to see how it affects the final smoothie.

🌀 serverSeed: Choose the type of blender (e.g., high-speed, slow masticating).
👅 clientSeed: Select your preference (e.g., sweet, sour).
🗓 nonce: Decide on the blending sequence or day of the week.
By changing these values, you can see how the final blend (result list) changes, giving you a unique smoothie each time.

Feel free to dive into this interactive process by providing your own values for serverSeed, clientSeed, and nonce, and let's see how your custom smoothie turns out!


------ COIN FLIP -------
🎲 How Results are Calculated in a Fair Game 🎲
Ensuring fairness and transparency, our game follows a precise method to calculate results. Here's a simplified breakdown with thematic coin icons:

Generate a Unique Combination 🪙
We create a unique blend using your client seed, a nonce (a once-only number), and the round. This guarantees every game's uniqueness.

Calculate the Hash 🪙➡️🔍
With the HMAC_SHA256 algorithm, the unique combination is transformed into a 64-character hexadecimal string, ensuring secure and unpredictable outcomes.

Convert to Number 🪙➡️🔢
The first 8 characters of the hash are converted into an integer, forming the basis for the game result.

Determine the Result 🪙➡️🎯
This integer is divided by 0x100000000 and then multiplied by 2 to find the game's final outcome, ensuring randomness and fairness.

Set a New Seed for Verification 🪙🔐
A new seed must be set for future verification, with the server seed encrypted to safeguard integrity until verification.

🍀 Good Luck! 🍀
Transparency and precision are the cornerstones of our fair game. These details are provided for those who appreciate the importance of understanding the fairness mechanisms in place.

Wishing you all the best as you play!
